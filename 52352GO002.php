	<h3> Long-term marijuana use linked to periodontal issues </h3>
	<p>
	<br><br>
	A long-term study in New Zealand found that smoking marijuana for 20 years caused poorer periodontal health. <br><br>

	But unlike tobacco use, it was not associated with other physical problems like lung cancer and heart disease.<br><br>

	The increased legalization of marijuana, which is approved in Oregon for medical and recreational use, has increased scientific interest in medical studies. But research is still limited by the federal classification of marijuana as a schedule 1 substance, defined as a drug with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use.<br><br>

	The study involved nearly 1,000 people born between 1972 and 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand who were followed from birth to 38 years. They were periodically assessed for a range of ailments through laboratory tests and self-reports.<br><br>

	For this research, scientists reviewed self-reported cannabis use at ages 18, 21, 26, 32 and 38. They also reviewed lab reports and personal assessments of physical health.<br><br>

	They found that higher cannabis use was associated with periodontal problems at age 38 after controlling for periodontal health at age 26 and overall tobacco. It was not associated with other health problems affecting the lungs, blood pressure, cholesterol, metabolism and body mass index.<br><br>

	"In general, our findings showed that cannabis use over 20 years was unrelated to health problems in early midlife," the study said.<br><br>

	The study was published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.<br><br>

	Like all studies, this one has a caveat: The health assessments at age 38 were based on blood draws and self-reports, which are less accurate than medical examinations.<br><br>
